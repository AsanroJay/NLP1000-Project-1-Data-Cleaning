Exodus,1,1,Now these are the names of the children of Israel who came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob:
Exodus,1,2,"Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah,"
Exodus,1,3,"Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin,"
Exodus,1,4,"Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher."
Exodus,1,5,"And all the souls who came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls, for Joseph was in Egypt already."
Exodus,1,6,"And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation."
Exodus,1,7,"And the children of Israel were fruitful and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them."
Exodus,1,8,"Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph."
Exodus,1,9,"And he said unto his people, “Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we."
Exodus,1,10,"Come on, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply and it come to pass, when there befalleth any war, that they join also unto our enemies and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land.”"
Exodus,1,11,"Therefore they set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses."
Exodus,1,12,"But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew; and they were grieved because of the children of Israel."
Exodus,1,13,And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor.
Exodus,1,14,"And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in mortar and in brick and in all manner of service in the field; all their service wherein they made them serve was with rigor."
Exodus,1,15,"And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah."
Exodus,1,16,"And he said, “When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women and see them upon the birthstools, if it be a son then ye shall kill him; but if it be a daughter then she shall live.”"
Exodus,1,17,"But the midwives feared God, and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive."
Exodus,1,18,"And the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said unto them, “Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?”"
Exodus,1,19,"And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, “Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.”"
Exodus,1,20,"Therefore God dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied and waxed very mighty."
Exodus,1,21,"And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that He made them houses."
Exodus,1,22,"And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, “Every son who is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.”"
Exodus,2,1,"And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took for a wife a daughter of Levi."
Exodus,2,2,"And the woman conceived and bore a son; and when she saw that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months."
Exodus,2,3,"And when she could no longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the reeds by the river’s brink."
Exodus,2,4,And his sister stood afar off to learn what would be done to him.
Exodus,2,5,"And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river, and her maidens walked along by the riverside; and when she saw the ark among the reeds, she sent her maid to fetch it."
Exodus,2,6,"And when she had opened it, she saw the child; and behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him and said, “This is one of the Hebrews’ children.”"
Exodus,2,7,"Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter, “Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?”"
Exodus,2,8,"And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Go.” And the maid went and called the child’s mother."
Exodus,2,9,"And Pharaoh’s daughter said unto her, “Take this child away and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages.” And the woman took the child, and nursed it."
Exodus,2,10,"And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses [that is, Drawn out], and she said, “Because I drew him out of the water.”"
Exodus,2,11,"And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren and looked on their burdens; and he spied an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren."
Exodus,2,12,"And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian and hid him in the sand."
Exodus,2,13,"And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together; and he said to him that did the wrong, “Why smitest thou thy fellow?”"
Exodus,2,14,"And he said, “Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? Intendest thou to kill me as thou killed the Egyptian?” And Moses feared and said, “Surely this thing is known.”"
Exodus,2,15,"Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian; and he sat down by a well."
Exodus,2,16,"Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters; and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock."
Exodus,2,17,"And the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock."
Exodus,2,18,"And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, “How is it that ye have come so soon today?”"
Exodus,2,19,"And they said, “An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us and watered the flock.”"
Exodus,2,20,"And he said unto his daughters, “And where is he? Why is it that ye have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.”"
Exodus,2,21,And Moses was content to dwell with the man; and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.
Exodus,2,22,"And she bore him a son, and he called his name Gershom [that is, A stranger there]; for he said, “I have been a stranger in a strange land.”"
Exodus,2,23,"And it came to pass in process of time that the king of Egypt died. And the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried; and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage."
Exodus,2,24,"And God heard their groaning, and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob."
Exodus,2,25,"And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God took heed of them."
Exodus,3,1,"Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian; and he led the flock to the back side of the desert and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb."
Exodus,3,2,"And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush; and he looked and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed."
Exodus,3,3,"And Moses said, “I will now turn aside and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.”"
Exodus,3,4,"And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said, “Moses, Moses.” And he said, “Here am I.”"
Exodus,3,5,"And He said, “Draw not nigh hither. Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.”"
Exodus,3,6,"Moreover He said, “I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God."
Exodus,3,7,"And the Lord said, “I have surely seen the affliction of My people who are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters, for I know their sorrows."
Exodus,3,8,"And I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey, unto the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites, and the Amorites and the Perizzites, and the Hivites and the Jebusites."
Exodus,3,9,"Now therefore behold, the cry of the children of Israel hath come unto Me, and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them."
Exodus,3,10,"Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth My people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.”"
Exodus,3,11,"And Moses said unto God, “Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?”"
Exodus,3,12,"And He said, “Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token unto thee that I have sent thee: when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.”"
Exodus,3,13,"And Moses said unto God, “Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel and shall say unto them, ‘The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you,’ and they shall say to me, ‘What is His name?’ what shall I say unto them?”"
Exodus,3,14,"And God said unto Moses, “ I Am That I Am .” And He said, “Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, ‘ I Am hath sent me unto you.’”"
Exodus,3,15,"And God said moreover unto Moses, “Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel: ‘The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob hath sent me unto you.’ This is My name for ever, and this is My memorial unto all generations."
Exodus,3,16,"Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, ‘The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob appeared unto me, saying, “I have surely visited you and seen that which is done to you in Egypt;"
Exodus,3,17,"and I have said I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites, and the Amorites and the Perizzites, and the Hivites and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.”’"
Exodus,3,18,"And they shall hearken to thy voice; and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, ‘The Lord God of the Hebrews hath met with us; and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days’ journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God.’"
Exodus,3,19,"And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand."
Exodus,3,20,And I will stretch out My hand and smite Egypt with all My wonders which I will do in the midst thereof; and after that he will let you go.
Exodus,3,21,"And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. And it shall come to pass that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty,"
Exodus,3,22,"but every woman shall borrow of her neighbor and of her that sojourneth in her house jewels of silver and jewels of gold and raiment; and ye shall put them upon your sons and upon your daughters, and ye shall despoil the Egyptians.”"
Exodus,4,1,"And Moses answered and said, “But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice; for they will say, ‘The Lord hath not appeared unto thee.’”"
Exodus,4,2,"And the Lord said unto him, “What is that in thine hand?” And he said, “A rod.”"
Exodus,4,3,"And He said, “Cast it on the ground.” And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it."
Exodus,4,4,"And the Lord said unto Moses, “Put forth thine hand and take it by the tail.” And he put forth his hand and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand—"
Exodus,4,5,"“that they may believe that the Lord God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob hath appeared unto thee.”"
Exodus,4,6,"And the Lord said furthermore unto him, “Put now thine hand into thy bosom.” And he put his hand into his bosom; and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow."
Exodus,4,7,"And He said, “Put thine hand into thy bosom again.” And he put his hand into his bosom again and plucked it out of his bosom, and behold, it was turned again as his other flesh."
Exodus,4,8,"“And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign."
Exodus,4,9,"And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river and pour it upon the dry land; and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.”"
Exodus,4,10,"And Moses said unto the Lord , “O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore nor since Thou hast spoken unto Thy servant; but I am slow of speech and of a slow tongue.”"
Exodus,4,11,"And the Lord said unto him, “Who hath made man’s mouth? Or who maketh the dumb or deaf, or the seeing or the blind? Have notI, the Lord ?"
Exodus,4,12,"Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth and teach thee what thou shalt say.”"
Exodus,4,13,"And he said, “O my Lord, send, I pray Thee, by the hand of him whom Thou wilt send.”"
Exodus,4,14,"And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses, and He said, “Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee; and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart."
Exodus,4,15,"And thou shalt speak unto him and put words in his mouth; and I will be with thy mouth and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do."
Exodus,4,16,"And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people; and he shall be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God."
Exodus,4,17,"And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs.”"
Exodus,4,18,"And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said unto him, “Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren who are in Egypt and see whether they are yet alive.” And Jethro said to Moses, “Go in peace.”"
Exodus,4,19,"And the Lord said unto Moses in Midian, “Go, return into Egypt; for all the men are dead who sought thy life.”"
Exodus,4,20,"And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt. And Moses took the rod of God in his hand."
Exodus,4,21,"And the Lord said unto Moses, “When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh which I have put in thine hand; but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go."
Exodus,4,22,"And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, ‘Thus saith the Lord : Israel is My son, even My firstborn."
Exodus,4,23,"And I say unto thee, “Let My son go, that he may serve Me.” And if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy firstborn.’”"
Exodus,4,24,"And it came to pass, on the way at the inn, that the Lord met him and sought to kill him."
Exodus,4,25,"Then Zipporah took a sharp stone and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet and said, “Surely a bloody husband art thou to me.”"
Exodus,4,26,"So He let him go; then she said, “A bloody husband thou art, because of the circumcision.”"
Exodus,4,27,"And the Lord said to Aaron, “Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.” And he went and met him on the mount of God, and kissed him."
Exodus,4,28,"And Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord who had sent him, and all the signs which He had commanded him."
Exodus,4,29,And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel.
Exodus,4,30,"And Aaron spoke all the words which the Lord had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people."
Exodus,4,31,"And the people believed; and when they heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel, and that He had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshiped."
Exodus,5,1,"And afterward Moses and Aaron went in and told Pharaoh, “Thus saith the Lord God of Israel: ‘Let My people go, that they may hold a feast unto Me in the wilderness.’”"
Exodus,5,2,"And Pharaoh said, “Who is the Lord , that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the Lord , neither will I let Israel go.”"
Exodus,5,3,"And they said, “The God of the Hebrews hath met with us. Let us go, we pray thee, three days’ journey into the desert and sacrifice unto the Lord our God, lest He fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword.”"
Exodus,5,4,"And the king of Egypt said unto them, “Why do ye, Moses and Aaron, delay the people from their work? Get you unto your burdens!”"
Exodus,5,5,"And Pharaoh said, “Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye make them rest from their burdens!”"
Exodus,5,6,"And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people and their officers, saying,"
Exodus,5,7,"“Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore. Let them go and gather straw for themselves."
Exodus,5,8,"And the tally of bricks which they made heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish any thereof. For they are idle; therefore they cry, saying, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to our God.’"
Exodus,5,9,"Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labor therein, and let them not regard vain words.”"
Exodus,5,10,"And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, “Thus saith Pharaoh: ‘I will not give you straw."
Exodus,5,11,"Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it; yet not any of your work shall be diminished.’”"
Exodus,5,12,So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.
Exodus,5,13,"And the taskmasters hastened them, saying, “Fulfill your works, your daily tasks, as when there was straw.”"
Exodus,5,14,"And the officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten and were demanded, “Why have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and today, as heretofore?”"
Exodus,5,15,"Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, “Why dealest thou thus with thy servants?"
Exodus,5,16,"There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, ‘Make brick!’ And behold, thy servants are beaten, but the fault is in thine own people.”"
Exodus,5,17,"But he said, “Ye are idle, ye are idle! Therefore ye say, ‘Let us go and do sacrifice to the Lord .’"
Exodus,5,18,"Go therefore now and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tally of bricks.”"
Exodus,5,19,"And the officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in evil straits after it was said, “Ye shall not diminish any from your bricks of your daily task.”"
Exodus,5,20,"And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way as they came forth from Pharaoh."
Exodus,5,21,"And they said unto them, “The Lord look upon you and judge, because ye have made our savor to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.”"
Exodus,5,22,"And Moses returned unto the Lord and said, “Lord, why hast Thou so evilly treated this people? Why is it that Thou hast sent me?"
Exodus,5,23,"For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast Thou delivered Thy people at all.”"
Exodus,6,1,"Then the Lord said unto Moses, “Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh; for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.”"
Exodus,6,2,"And God spoke unto Moses and said unto him, “I am the Lord ."
Exodus,6,3,"And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob by the name of God Almighty, but by My name Jehovah was I not known to them."
Exodus,6,4,"And I have also established My covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers."
Exodus,6,5,"And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered My covenant."
Exodus,6,6,"Therefore say unto the children of Israel: ‘I am the Lord , and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out from their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments."
Exodus,6,7,"And I will take you to Me for a people, and I will be to you a God; and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God, who bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians."
Exodus,6,8,"And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning which I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it to you for a heritage: I am the Lord .’”"
Exodus,6,9,"And Moses spoke so unto the children of Israel, but they hearkened not unto Moses from anguish of spirit and from cruel bondage."
Exodus,6,10,"And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,"
Exodus,6,11,"“Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.”"
Exodus,6,12,"And Moses spoke before the Lord , saying, “Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me. How then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips?”"
Exodus,6,13,"And the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt."
Exodus,6,14,"These are the heads of their fathers’ houses. The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel: Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi; these are the families of Reuben."
Exodus,6,15,"And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel and Jamin, and Ohad and Jachin and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman; these are the families of Simeon."
Exodus,6,16,And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations: Gershon and Kohath and Merari; and the years of the life of Levi were a hundred thirty and seven years.
Exodus,6,17,"The sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimi, according to their families."
Exodus,6,18,"And the sons of Kohath: Amram and Izhar, and Hebron and Uzziel; and the years of the life of Kohath were a hundred thirty and three years."

Exodus,6,26,"These are that Aaron and Moses to whom the Lord said, “Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies.”"
Exodus,6,27,These are they who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt. These are that Moses and Aaron.
Exodus,6,28,"And it came to pass on the day when the Lord spoke unto Moses in the land of Egypt,"
Exodus,6,29,"that the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, “I am the Lord . Speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee.”"
Exodus,6,30,"And Moses said before the Lord , “Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?”"
Exodus,7,1,"And the Lord said unto Moses, “See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh, and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet."
Exodus,7,2,"Thou shalt speak all that I command thee; and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his land."
Exodus,7,3,"And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and multiply My signs and My wonders in the land of Egypt."
Exodus,7,4,"But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay My hand upon Egypt and bring forth Mine armies and My people, the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments."
Exodus,7,5,"And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord , when I stretch forth Mine hand upon Egypt and bring out the children of Israel from among them.”"
Exodus,7,6,And Moses and Aaron did as the Lord commanded them; so did they.
Exodus,7,7,"And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old when they spoke unto Pharaoh."
Exodus,7,8,"And the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,"
Exodus,7,9,"“When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, ‘Show a miracle for yourselves,’ then thou shalt say unto Aaron, ‘Take thy rod and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent.’”"
Exodus,7,10,"And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the Lord had commanded; and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent."
Exodus,7,11,"Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers. Now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments."
Exodus,7,12,"For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents; but Aaron’s rod swallowed up their rods."
Exodus,7,13,"And He hardened Pharaoh’s heart, that he hearkened not unto them, as the Lord had said."
Exodus,7,14,"And the Lord said unto Moses, “Pharaoh’s heart is hardened; he refuseth to let the people go."

Exodus,7,16,"And thou shalt say unto him, ‘The Lord God of the Hebrews hath sent me unto thee, saying, “Let My people go, that they may serve Me in the wilderness”; and behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear."
Exodus,7,17,"Thus saith the Lord : “In this thou shalt know that I am the Lord : Behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood."
Exodus,7,18,"And the fish that are in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink of the water of the river.”’”"
Exodus,7,19,"And the Lord spoke unto Moses, “Say unto Aaron, ‘Take thy rod and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone.’”"
Exodus,7,20,"And Moses and Aaron did so, as the Lord commanded; and he lifted up the rod and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood."

Exodus,7,23,"And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also."
Exodus,7,24,"And all the Egyptians dug round about the river for water to drink, for they could not drink of the water of the river."
Exodus,7,25,And seven days were fulfilled after the Lord had smitten the river.
Exodus,8,1,"And the Lord spoke unto Moses, “Go unto Pharaoh and say unto him, ‘Thus saith the Lord : Let My people go, that they may serve Me."
Exodus,8,2,"And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs."
Exodus,8,3,"And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants and upon thy people, and into thine ovens and into thy kneading troughs."
Exodus,8,4,And the frogs shall come up both on thee and upon thy people and upon all thy servants.’”
Exodus,8,5,"And the Lord spoke unto Moses, “Say unto Aaron, ‘Stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.’”"
Exodus,8,6,"And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt."
Exodus,8,7,"And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt."
Exodus,8,8,"Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said, “Entreat the Lord , that he may take away the frogs from me and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the Lord .”"
Exodus,8,9,"And Moses said unto Pharaoh, “Glory over me: When shall I entreat for thee and for thy servants and for thy people to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses, that they may remain in the river only?”"
Exodus,8,10,"And he said, “Tomorrow.” And Moses said, “Be it according to thy word, that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the Lord our God."
Exodus,8,11,"And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses and from thy servants and from thy people. They shall remain in the river only.”"
Exodus,8,12,And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh; and Moses cried unto the Lord because of the frogs which He had brought against Pharaoh.
Exodus,8,13,"And the Lord did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields."
Exodus,8,14,"And they gathered them together upon heaps, and the land stank."
Exodus,8,15,"But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart and hearkened not unto them, as the Lord had said."
Exodus,8,16,"And the Lord said unto Moses, “Say unto Aaron, ‘Stretch out thy rod and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.’”"
Exodus,8,17,"And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice on man and on beast. All the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt."
Exodus,8,18,"And the magicians so did with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not; so there were lice upon man and upon beast."
Exodus,8,19,"Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, “This is the finger of God.” And Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them, as the Lord had said."
Exodus,8,20,"And the Lord said unto Moses, “Rise up early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh. Lo, he cometh forth to the water, and say unto him, ‘Thus saith the Lord : Let My people go, that they may serve Me."
Exodus,8,21,"Else, if thou wilt not let My people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants and upon thy people and into thy houses; and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are."
Exodus,8,22,"And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen in which My people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there, to the end thou mayest know that I am the Lord in the midst of the earth."
Exodus,8,23,And I will put a division between My people and thy people. Tomorrow shall this sign be.’”
Exodus,8,24,"And the Lord did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants’ houses and into all the land of Egypt. The land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies."
Exodus,8,25,"And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron and said, “Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land.”"
Exodus,8,26,"And Moses said, “It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the Lord our God. Lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?"
Exodus,8,27,"We will go three days’ journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the Lord our God, as He shall command us.”"
Exodus,8,28,"And Pharaoh said, “I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the Lord your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away. Entreat for me.”"
Exodus,8,29,"And Moses said, “Behold, I go out from thee, and I will entreat the Lord that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants and from his people tomorrow; but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the Lord .”"
Exodus,8,30,And Moses went out from Pharaoh and entreated the Lord .
Exodus,8,31,"And the Lord did according to the word of Moses, and He removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one."
Exodus,8,32,"And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go."
Exodus,9,1,"Then the Lord said unto Moses, “Go in unto Pharaoh and tell him, ‘Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews: Let My people go, that they may serve Me."
Exodus,9,2,"For if thou refuse to let them go and wilt hold them still,"
Exodus,9,3,"behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thy cattle which are in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the sheep. There shall be a very grievous pestilence."
Exodus,9,4,And the Lord shall distinguish between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt; and there shall nothing die of all that belong to the children of Israel.’”
Exodus,9,5,"And the Lord appointed a set time, saying, “Tomorrow the Lord shall do this thing in the land.”"
Exodus,9,6,"And the Lord did that thing on the morrow; and all the cattle of Egypt died, but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one."
Exodus,9,7,"And Pharaoh sent, and behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go."
Exodus,9,8,"And the Lord said unto Moses and unto Aaron, “Take to you handfuls of ashes from the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh."
Exodus,9,9,"And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains, upon man and upon beast throughout all the land of Egypt.”"
Exodus,9,10,"And they took ashes from the furnace and stood before Pharaoh, and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became boils breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast."
Exodus,9,11,"And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils, for the boils were upon the magicians and upon all the Egyptians."
Exodus,9,12,"And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them, as the Lord had spoken unto Moses."
Exodus,9,13,"And the Lord said unto Moses, “Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh and say unto him, ‘Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews: Let My people go, that they may serve Me."
Exodus,9,14,"For I will at this time send all My plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants and upon thy people, that thou mayest know that there is none like Me in all the earth."
Exodus,9,15,"For now I will stretch out My hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence, and thou shalt be cut off from the earth."
Exodus,9,16,"And in very deed, for this cause have I raised thee up: to show in thee My power, and that My name may be declared throughout all the earth."
Exodus,9,17,"As yet exaltest thou thyself against My people, that thou wilt not let them go?"
Exodus,9,18,"Behold, tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now."
Exodus,9,19,"Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle and all that thou hast in the field, for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field and shall not be brought home, the hail shallcome down upon them, and they shall die.’”"
Exodus,9,20,"He that feared the word of the Lord among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses,"
Exodus,9,21,and he that regarded not the word of the Lord left his servants and his cattle in the field.
Exodus,9,22,"And the Lord said unto Moses, “Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man and upon beast and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.”"
Exodus,9,23,"And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven; and the Lord sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the Lord rained hail upon the land of Egypt."
Exodus,9,24,"So there was hail and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation."
Exodus,9,25,"And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field and broke every tree of the field."
Exodus,9,26,"Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail."
Exodus,9,27,"And Pharaoh sent and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, “I have sinned this time. The Lord is righteous, and I and my people are wicked."
Exodus,9,28,"Entreat the Lord (for it is enough), that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer.”"
Exodus,9,29,"And Moses said unto him, “As soon as I have gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto the Lord ; and the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail, that thou mayest know that the earth is the Lord ’S."
Exodus,9,30,"But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the Lord God.”"
Exodus,9,31,"And the flax and the barley were smitten; for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in bolls."
Exodus,9,32,"But the wheat and the rye were not smitten, for they were not grown up."
Exodus,9,33,"And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto the Lord ; and the thunder and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth."
Exodus,9,34,"And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder had ceased, he sinned yet more and hardened his heart, he and his servants."
Exodus,9,35,"And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the children of Israel go, as the Lord had spoken by Moses."
Exodus,10,1,"And the Lord said unto Moses, “Go in unto Pharaoh; for I have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants, that I might show these My signs before him;"
Exodus,10,2,"and that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son and of thy son’s son what things I have wrought in Egypt, and My signs which I have done among them, that ye may know that I am the Lord .”"
Exodus,10,3,"And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh and said unto him, “Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews: ‘How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before Me? Let My people go, that they may serve Me."
Exodus,10,4,"Else, if thou refuse to let My people go, behold, tomorrow will I bring the locusts into thy border."
Exodus,10,5,"And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one shall not be able to see the earth; and they shall eat the residue of that which has escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field."
Exodus,10,6,"And they shall fill thy houses and the houses of all thy servants and the houses of all the Egyptians — which neither thy fathers nor thy fathers’ fathers have seen since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day.’” And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh."
Exodus,10,7,"And Pharaoh’s servants said unto him, “How long shall this man be a snare unto us? Let the men go, that they may serve the Lord their God. Knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?”"
Exodus,10,8,"And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh; and he said unto them, “Go, serve the Lord your God. But who are they that shall go?”"
Exodus,10,9,"And Moses said, “We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go, for we must hold a feast unto the Lord .”"
Exodus,10,10,"And he said unto them, “Let the Lord be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones. Look to it, for evil is before you."
Exodus,10,11,"Not so! Go now ye that are men, and serve the Lord , for that ye did desire.” And they were driven out from Pharaoh’s presence."
Exodus,10,12,"And the Lord said unto Moses, “Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left.”"
Exodus,10,13,"And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the Lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day and all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts."
Exodus,10,14,"And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the borders of Egypt. Very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such."
Exodus,10,15,"For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they ate every herb of the land and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left, and there remained not any green thing in the trees or in the herbs of the field through all the land of Egypt."
Exodus,10,16,"Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste, and he said, “I have sinned against the Lord your God, and against you."
Exodus,10,17,"Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and entreat the Lord your God, that he may take away from me this death only.”"
Exodus,10,18,And he went out from Pharaoh and entreated the Lord .
Exodus,10,19,"And the Lord turned a mighty, strong west wind, which took away the locusts and cast them into the Red Sea. There remained not one locust in all the borders of Egypt."
Exodus,10,20,"But the Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go."
Exodus,10,21,"And the Lord said unto Moses, “Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.”"
Exodus,10,22,"And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven, and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days."
Exodus,10,23,"They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days; but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings."
Exodus,10,24,"And Pharaoh called unto Moses and said, “Go ye, serve the Lord ; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed. Let your little ones also go with you.”"
Exodus,10,25,"And Moses said, “Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the Lord our God."
Exodus,10,26,"Our cattle also shall go with us. There shall not a hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the Lord our God, and we know not with what we must serve the Lord until we come thither.”"
Exodus,10,27,"But the Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let them go."
Exodus,10,28,"And Pharaoh said unto him, “Get thee from me! Take heed to thyself! See my face no more, for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die!”"
Exodus,10,29,"And Moses said, “Thou hast spoken well. I will see thy face again no more.”"
Exodus,11,1,"And the Lord said unto Moses, “Yet will I bring one plague more upon Pharaoh and upon Egypt. Afterwards he will let you go hence. When he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether."
Exodus,11,2,"Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow from his neighbor, and every woman from her neighbor, jewels of silver and jewels of gold.”"
Exodus,11,3,And the Lord gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt in the sight of Pharaoh’s servants and in the sight of the people.
Exodus,11,4,"And Moses said, “Thus saith the Lord : ‘About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt;"
Exodus,11,5,"and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant who is behind the mill, and all the firstborn of beasts."
Exodus,11,6,"And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more."
Exodus,11,7,"But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast, that ye may know how the Lord doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.’"
Exodus,11,8,"And all these thy servants shall come down unto me and bowdown themselves unto me, saying, ‘Get thee out, and all the people who follow thee!’ And after that I will go out.” And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger."
Exodus,11,9,"And the Lord said unto Moses, “Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that My wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.”"
Exodus,11,10,"And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh; and the Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land."
Exodus,12,1,"And the Lord spoke unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,"
Exodus,12,2,“This month shall be unto you the beginning of months; it shall be the first month of the year to you.
Exodus,12,3,"Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, ‘On the tenth day of this month they shall take for themselves every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for a house."
Exodus,12,4,"And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbor next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb."
Exodus,12,5,"Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year; ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats."
Exodus,12,6,"And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month, and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening."
Exodus,12,7,"And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses wherein they shall eat it."
Exodus,12,8,"And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roasted with fire; and with unleavened bread and with bitter herbs they shall eat it."
Exodus,12,9,"Eat not of it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roasted with fire — his head with his legs and with the viscera thereof."
Exodus,12,10,"And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning, and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire."
Exodus,12,11,"And thus shall ye eat it: with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste; it is the Lord ’S Passover."
Exodus,12,12,"For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the Lord ."
Exodus,12,13,"And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are; and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt."
Exodus,12,14,"“‘And this day shall be unto you for a memorial, and ye shall keep it a feast to the Lord throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever."
Exodus,12,15,"Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread. Even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses; for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel."
Exodus,12,16,"And in the first day there shall be a holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be a holy convocation to you. No manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done by you."

Exodus,12,20,Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread.’”
Exodus,12,21,"Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel and said unto them, “Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the Passover."
Exodus,12,22,"And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you shall go out from the door of his house until the morning."
Exodus,12,23,"For the Lord will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when He seeth the blood upon the lintel and on the two side posts, the Lord will pass over the door and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you."
Exodus,12,24,And ye shall observe this thing as an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever.
Exodus,12,25,"And it shall come to pass, when ye come to the land which the Lord will give you, according as He hath promised, that ye shall keep this service."
Exodus,12,26,"And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, ‘What mean ye by this service?’"
Exodus,12,27,"that ye shall say, ‘It is the sacrifice of the Lord ’S Passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt when He smote the Egyptians and delivered our houses.’” And the people bowed their heads and worshiped."
Exodus,12,28,"And the children of Israel went away, and did as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron; so did they."
Exodus,12,29,"And it came to pass, that at midnight the Lord smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne, unto the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon, and all the firstborn of cattle."
Exodus,12,30,"And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he and all his servants and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house where there was not one dead."
Exodus,12,31,"And he called for Moses and Aaron by night and said, “Rise up, and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel! And go, serve the Lord , as ye have said."
Exodus,12,32,"Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said; and be gone, and bless me also.”"
Exodus,12,33,"And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, “We are all dead men.”"
Exodus,12,34,"And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading troughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders."
Exodus,12,35,"And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses, and they borrowed from the Egyptians jewels of silver and jewels of gold and raiment."
Exodus,12,36,"And the Lord gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as they required. And they despoiled the Egyptians."
Exodus,12,37,"And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot who were men, besides children."
Exodus,12,38,"And a mixed multitude went up also with them, and flocks and herds, even very much cattle."
Exodus,12,39,"And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt; for it was not leavened because they were thrust out of Egypt and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual."
Exodus,12,40,Now the sojourning of the children of Israel who dwelt in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years.
Exodus,12,41,"And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even on the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt."
Exodus,12,42,It is a night to be much observed unto the Lord for bringing them out from the land of Egypt. This is that night of the Lord to be observed by all the children of Israel in their generations.
Exodus,12,43,"And the Lord said unto Moses and Aaron, “This is the ordinance of the Passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof;"
Exodus,12,44,"but every man’s servant who is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof."
Exodus,12,45,A foreigner and a hired servant shall not eat thereof.
Exodus,12,46,"In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth any of the flesh abroad out of the house, neither shall ye break a bone thereof."
Exodus,12,47,All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.
Exodus,12,48,"And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee and will keep the Passover to the Lord , let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land, for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof."
Exodus,12,49,One law shall be for him that is homeborn and for the stranger who sojourneth among you.”
Exodus,12,50,"Thus did all the children of Israel; as the Lord commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they."
Exodus,12,51,And it came to pass the selfsame day that the Lord brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.
Exodus,13,1,"And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,"
Exodus,13,2,"“Sanctify unto Me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast; it is Mine.”"
Exodus,13,3,"And Moses said unto the people, “Remember this day in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the Lord brought you out from this place. There shall no leavened bread be eaten."
Exodus,13,4,"This day came ye out, in the month Abib."
Exodus,13,5,"“And it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, which He swore unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month."
Exodus,13,6,"Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the Lord ."
Exodus,13,7,"Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters."
Exodus,13,8,"And thou shalt show thy son in that day, saying, ‘This is done because of that which the Lord did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt.’"
Exodus,13,9,"And it shall be as a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the Lord ’S law may be in thy mouth; for with a strong hand hath the Lord brought thee out of Egypt."
Exodus,13,10,Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year.
Exodus,13,11,"“And it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, as He swore unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it to thee,"
Exodus,13,12,"that thou shalt set apart unto the Lord all that openeth the womb, and every firstling that cometh from a beast which thou hast; the males shall be the Lord ’S."
Exodus,13,13,"And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck; and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem."
Exodus,13,14,"And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, ‘What is this?’ that thou shalt say unto him, ‘By strength of hand the Lord brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage."
Exodus,13,15,"And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the Lord slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of beast; therefore I sacrifice to the Lord all that openeth the womb, being males; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem.’"
Exodus,13,16,"And it shall be as a token upon thine hand, and as frontlets between thine eyes; for by strength of hand the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt.”"
Exodus,13,17,"And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, “Lest perhaps the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt.”"
Exodus,13,18,"But God led the people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red Sea; and the children of Israel went up by five in a rank out of the land of Egypt."
Exodus,13,19,"And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him; for he had strictly sworn the children of Israel, saying, “God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.”"
Exodus,13,20,"And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham on the edge of the wilderness."
Exodus,13,21,"And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud to lead them the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, to go by day and night."
Exodus,13,22,He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night from before the people.
Exodus,14,1,"And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,"
Exodus,14,2,"“Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, opposite Baalzephon; before it shall ye encamp by the sea."
Exodus,14,3,"For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, ‘They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.’"
Exodus,14,4,"And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will be honored above Pharaoh, and above all his host, that the Egyptians may know that I am the Lord .” And they did so."
Exodus,14,5,"And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled; and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, “Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?”"
Exodus,14,6,"And he made ready his chariot and took his people with him,"
Exodus,14,7,and he took six hundred chosen chariots and all the chariots of Egypt and captains over every one of them.
Exodus,14,8,"And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel; and the children of Israel went out with a high hand."
Exodus,14,9,"But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon."
Exodus,14,10,"And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid; and the children of Israel cried out unto the Lord ."
Exodus,14,11,"And they said unto Moses, “Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?"
Exodus,14,12,"Is not this the word that we told thee in Egypt, saying, ‘Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians’? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.”"
Exodus,14,13,"And Moses said unto the people, “Fear ye not. Stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord , which He will show to you today; for the Egyptians whom ye have seen today, ye shall see them again no more for ever."
Exodus,14,14,"The Lord shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.”"
Exodus,14,15,"And the Lord said unto Moses, “Why criest thou unto Me? Speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward."
Exodus,14,16,"But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea and divide it; and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea."
Exodus,14,17,"And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them; and I will get Myself honor above Pharaoh and above all his host, above his chariots and above his horsemen."
Exodus,14,18,"And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord when I have gotten Myself honor above Pharaoh, above his chariots, and above his horsemen.”"
Exodus,14,19,"And the angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face and stood behind them."
Exodus,14,20,"And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these, so that the one came not near the other all the night."
Exodus,14,21,"And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided."
Exodus,14,22,"And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground, and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left."
Exodus,14,23,"And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh’s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen."
Exodus,14,24,"And it came to pass that in the morning watch the Lord looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians."
Exodus,14,25,"And He took off their chariot wheels, that they drove them heavily, so that the Egyptians said, “Let us flee from the face of Israel, for the Lord fighteth for them against the Egyptians.”"
Exodus,14,26,"And the Lord said unto Moses, “Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.”"
Exodus,14,27,"And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared. And the Egyptians fled against it, and the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea."
Exodus,14,28,"And the waters returned, and covered the chariots and the horsemen and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them. There remained not so much as one of them."
Exodus,14,29,"But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea, and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left."
Exodus,14,30,"Thus the Lord saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the seashore."
Exodus,14,31,"And Israel saw that great work which the Lord did upon the Egyptians; and the people feared the Lord , and believed the Lord and His servant Moses."
Exodus,15,1,"Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord , and spoke, saying, “I will sing unto the Lord , for He hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath He thrown into the sea."
Exodus,15,2,"The Lord is my strength and song, and He has become my salvation; He is my God, and I will prepare Him a habitation; my father’s God, and I will exalt Him."
Exodus,15,3,The Lord is a man of war; the Lord is His name.
Exodus,15,4,Pharaoh’s chariots and his host hath He cast into the sea; his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red Sea.
Exodus,15,5,The depths have covered them; they sank into the bottom as a stone.
Exodus,15,6,"Thy right hand, O Lord , has become glorious in power; Thy right hand, O Lord , hath dashed in pieces the enemy."
Exodus,15,7,"And in the greatness of Thine excellency Thou hast overthrown them that rose up against Thee; Thou sentest forth Thy wrath, which consumed them as stubble."
Exodus,15,8,"And with the blast of Thy nostrils the waters were gathered together, the floods stood upright as a heap, and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea."
Exodus,15,9,"The enemy said, ‘I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them. I will draw my sword; my hand shall destroy them.’"
Exodus,15,10,"Thou didst blow with Thy wind, the sea covered them; they sank as lead in the mighty waters."
Exodus,15,11,"“Who is like unto Thee, O Lord , among the gods? Who is like Thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?"
Exodus,15,12,Thou stretchedst out Thy right hand; the earth swallowed them.
Exodus,15,13,Thou in Thy mercy hast led forth the people whom Thou hast redeemed; Thou hast guided them in Thy strength unto Thy holy habitation.
Exodus,15,14,“The people shall hear and be afraid; sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina.
Exodus,15,15,"Then the chiefs of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away."

Exodus,15,17,"Thou shalt bring them in and plant them in the mountain of Thine inheritance, in the place, O Lord , which Thou hast made for Thee to dwell in, in the sanctuary, O Lord, which Thy hands have established."
Exodus,15,18,The Lord shall reign for ever and ever.”
Exodus,15,19,"For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the Lord brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea."
Exodus,15,20,"And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances."
Exodus,15,21,"And Miriam answered them: “Sing ye to the Lord , for He hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath He thrown into the sea!”"
Exodus,15,22,"So Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea, and they went out into the Wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water."
Exodus,15,23,"And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter. Therefore the name of it was called Marah [that is, Bitterness]."
Exodus,15,24,"And the people murmured against Moses, saying, “What shall we drink?”"
Exodus,15,25,"And he cried unto the Lord ; and the Lord showed him a tree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet. There He made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there He put them to the proof,"
Exodus,15,26,"and said, “If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, and wilt do that which is right in His sight, and wilt give ear to His commandments and keep all His statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee which I have brought upon the Egyptians; for I am the Lord that healeth thee.”"
Exodus,15,27,"And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water and threescore and ten palm trees; and they encamped there by the waters."
Exodus,16,1,"And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the Wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt."
Exodus,16,2,And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness.
Exodus,16,3,"And the children of Israel said unto them, “Would to God we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the fleshpots and when we ate bread to the full! For ye have brought us forth into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger.”"
Exodus,16,4,"Then said the Lord unto Moses, “Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may put them to the proof, whether they will walk in My law, or no."
Exodus,16,5,"And it shall come to pass that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in, and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.”"
Exodus,16,6,"And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, “At evening, then ye shall know that the Lord hath brought you out from the land of Egypt;"
Exodus,16,7,"and in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the Lord , for He heareth your murmurings against the Lord . And what are we, that ye murmur against us?”"
Exodus,16,8,"And Moses said, “This shall be when the Lord shall give you in the evening flesh to eat and in the morning bread to the full, for the Lord heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against Him. And what are we? Your murmurings are not against us, but against the Lord .”"
Exodus,16,9,"And Moses spoke unto Aaron, “Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, ‘Come near before the Lord , for He hath heard your murmurings.’”"
Exodus,16,10,"And it came to pass, as Aaron spoke unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud."
Exodus,16,11,"And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,"
Exodus,16,12,"“I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel. Speak unto them, saying, ‘At evening ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God.’”"
Exodus,16,13,"And it came to pass that at evening the quails came up and covered the camp, and in the morning the dew lay round about the host."
Exodus,16,14,"And when the dew that lay had gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoarfrost on the ground."
Exodus,16,15,"And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, “What is this?” For they knew not what it was. And Moses said unto them, “This is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat."
Exodus,16,16,"This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded: ‘Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the number of your persons. Take ye every man for those who are in his tents.’”"
Exodus,16,17,"And the children of Israel did so and gathered, some more, some less."
Exodus,16,18,"And when they measured it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating."
Exodus,16,19,"And Moses said, “Let no man leave any of it until the morning.”"
Exodus,16,20,"Notwithstanding, they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left part of it until the morning, and it bred worms and stank. And Moses was wroth with them."
Exodus,16,21,"And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating; and when the sun waxed hot, it melted."
Exodus,16,22,"And it came to pass that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man; and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses."
Exodus,16,23,"And he said unto them, “This is that which the Lord hath said: ‘Tomorrow is the rest of the holy Sabbath unto the Lord . Bake that which ye will bake today, and boil what ye will boil; and that which remaineth over lay up for yourselves to be kept until the morning.’”"
Exodus,16,24,"And they laid it up until the morning, as Moses bade; and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein."
Exodus,16,25,"And Moses said, “Eat that today, for today is a Sabbath unto the Lord . Today ye shall not find it in the field."
Exodus,16,26,"Six days ye shall gather it, but on the seventh day, which is the Sabbath, in it there shall be none.”"
Exodus,16,27,"And it came to pass that there went out some of the people on the seventh day to gather, and they found none."
Exodus,16,28,"And the Lord said unto Moses, “How long refuse ye to keep My commandments and My laws?"
Exodus,16,29,"See, for the Lord hath given you the Sabbath; therefore He giveth you on the sixth day the bread for two days. Abide ye every man in his place. Let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.”"
Exodus,16,30,So the people rested on the seventh day.
Exodus,16,31,"And the house of Israel called the name thereof manna; and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey."
Exodus,16,32,"And Moses said, “This is the thing which the Lord commandeth: ‘Fill an omer with it to be kept for your generations, that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.’”"
Exodus,16,33,"And Moses said unto Aaron, “Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the Lord to be kept for your generations.”"
Exodus,16,34,"As the Lord commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the testimony, to be kept."
Exodus,16,35,"And the children of Israel ate manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited. They ate manna until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan."
Exodus,16,36,Now an omer is a tenth part of an ephah.
Exodus,17,1,"And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the Wilderness of Sin after their journeys, according to the commandment of the Lord , and pitched camp in Rephidim; and there was no water for the people to drink."
Exodus,17,2,"Therefore the people chided Moses and said, “Give us water that we may drink.” And Moses said unto them, “Why chide ye me? Why do ye tempt the Lord ?”"
Exodus,17,3,"And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses and said, “Why is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?”"
Exodus,17,4,"And Moses cried unto the Lord , saying, “What shall I do unto this people? They are almost ready to stone me!”"
Exodus,17,5,"And the Lord said unto Moses, “Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod with which thou smotest the river, take in thine hand and go."
Exodus,17,6,"Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink.” And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel."
Exodus,17,7,"And he called the name of the place Massah [that is, Temptation], and Meribah [that is, Chiding], because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the Lord , saying, “Is the Lord among us or not?”"
Exodus,17,8,Then came Amalek and fought with Israel in Rephidim.
Exodus,17,9,"And Moses said unto Joshua, “Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand.”"
Exodus,17,10,"So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek; and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill."
Exodus,17,11,"And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed; and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed."
Exodus,17,12,"But Moses’ hands were heavy; and they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat thereon. And Aaron and Hur held up his hands, the one on the one side and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun."
Exodus,17,13,And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.
Exodus,17,14,"And the Lord said unto Moses, “Write this for a memorial in a book, and recount it in the ears of Joshua; for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.”"
Exodus,17,15,"And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovahnissi [that is, The Lord my banner];"
Exodus,17,16,"for he said, “Because the Lord hath sworn that the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.”"
Exodus,18,1,"When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses and for Israel His people, and that the Lord had brought Israel out of Egypt,"
Exodus,18,2,"then Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took Zipporah, Moses’ wife, after Moses had sent her back"
Exodus,18,3,"and her two sons (of whom the name of the one was Gershom [that is, A stranger there], for he said, “I have been an alien in a strange land”;"
Exodus,18,4,"and the name of the other was Eliezer [that is, My God is a help], “For the God of my father,” said he, “was my help and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh”);"
Exodus,18,5,"and Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God."
Exodus,18,6,"And he said unto Moses, “I, thy father-in-law Jethro, have come unto thee and thy wife and her two sons with her.”"
Exodus,18,7,"And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and did obeisance and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare, and they came into the tent."
Exodus,18,8,"And Moses told his father-in-law all that the Lord had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, and all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the Lord delivered them."
Exodus,18,9,"And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the Lord had done to Israel, whom He had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians."
Exodus,18,10,"And Jethro said, “Blessed be the Lord , who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians."
Exodus,18,11,"Now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods; for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly, He was above them.”"
Exodus,18,12,"And Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God; and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses’ father-in-law before God."
Exodus,18,13,"And it came to pass on the morrow that Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening."
Exodus,18,14,"And when Moses’ father-in-law saw all that he did for the people, he said, “What is this thing that thou doest for the people? Why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto evening?”"
Exodus,18,15,"And Moses said unto his father-in-law, “Because the people come unto me to inquire of God."
Exodus,18,16,"When they have a matter, they come unto me, and I judge between one and another, and I make them know the statutes of God and His laws.”"
Exodus,18,17,"And Moses’ father-in-law said unto him, “The thing that thou doest is not good."
Exodus,18,18,"Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou and this people who are with thee. For this thing is too heavy for thee. Thou art not able to perform it thyself alone."
Exodus,18,19,"Hearken now unto my voice! I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to Godward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God."
Exodus,18,20,"And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt show them the way wherein they must walk and the work that they must do."
Exodus,18,21,"Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God — men of truth, hating covetousness — and place such over them to be rulers of thousands and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties and rulers of tens."
Exodus,18,22,"And let them judge the people at all seasons; and it shall be that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge. So shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee."
Exodus,18,23,"If thou shalt do this thing and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.”"
Exodus,18,24,"So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said."
Exodus,18,25,"And Moses chose able men out of all Israel and made them heads over the people: rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens."
Exodus,18,26,"And they judged the people at all seasons. The hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves."
Exodus,18,27,"And Moses let his father-in-law depart, and he went his way into his own land."
Exodus,19,1,"In the third month after the children of Israel had gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the Wilderness of Sinai."
Exodus,19,2,"For they had departed from Rephidim, and had come to the desert of Sinai and had pitched camp in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount."
Exodus,19,3,"And Moses went up unto God, and the Lord called unto him out of the mountain, saying, “Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel:"
Exodus,19,4,"‘Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles’ wings and brought you unto Myself."
Exodus,19,5,"Now therefore, if ye will obey My voice indeed and keep My covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto Me above all people; for all the earth is Mine."
Exodus,19,6,And ye shall be unto Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.”
Exodus,19,7,"And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the Lord commanded him."
Exodus,19,8,"And all the people answered together and said, “All that the Lord hath spoken we will do.” And Moses returned the words of the people unto the Lord ."
Exodus,19,9,"And the Lord said unto Moses, “Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever.” And Moses told the words of the people unto the Lord ."
Exodus,19,10,"And the Lord said unto Moses, “Go unto the people and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their clothes"
Exodus,19,11,and be ready against the third day; for the third day the Lord will come down in the sight of all the people upon Mount Sinai.
Exodus,19,12,"And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, ‘Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount or touch the border of it. Whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death."
Exodus,19,13,"There shall not a hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live.’ When the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.”"
Exodus,19,14,"And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes."
Exodus,19,15,"And he said unto the people, “Be ready against the third day. Come not at your wives.”"
Exodus,19,16,"And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud, so that all the people who were in the camp trembled."
Exodus,19,17,"And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the nether part of the mount."
Exodus,19,18,"And Mount Sinai was altogether in smoke, because the Lord descended upon it in fire; and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly."
Exodus,19,19,"And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long and waxed louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice."
Exodus,19,20,"And the Lord came down upon Mount Sinai, on the top of the mount; and the Lord called Moses up to the top of the mount, and Moses went up."
Exodus,19,21,"And the Lord said unto Moses, “Go down. Charge the people, lest they break through to gaze unto the Lord , and many of them perish."
Exodus,19,22,"And let the priests also, who come near to the Lord , sanctify themselves, lest the Lord break forth upon them.”"
Exodus,19,23,"And Moses said unto the Lord , “The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai; for Thou charged us, saying, ‘Set bounds about the mount and sanctify it.’”"
Exodus,19,24,"And the Lord said unto him, “Away! Get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou and Aaron with thee; but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the Lord , lest He break forth upon them.”"
Exodus,19,25,So Moses went down unto the people and spoke unto them.
Exodus,20,1,"And God spoke all these words, saying:"
Exodus,20,2,"“I am the Lord thy God, who have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage."
Exodus,20,3,“Thou shalt have no other gods before Me.
Exodus,20,4,"“Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth."
Exodus,20,5,"Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them; for I, the Lord thy God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate Me,"
Exodus,20,6,and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love Me and keep My commandments.
Exodus,20,7,"“Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh His name in vain."
Exodus,20,8,"“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy."
Exodus,20,9,Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work;
Exodus,20,10,"but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God. In it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates."
Exodus,20,11,"For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it."
Exodus,20,12,"“Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee."
Exodus,20,13,“Thou shalt not kill.
Exodus,20,14,“Thou shalt not commit adultery.
Exodus,20,15,“Thou shalt not steal.
Exodus,20,16,“Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.
Exodus,20,17,"“Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s house; thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy neighbor’s.”"
Exodus,20,18,"And all the people saw the thunderings and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet and the mountain smoking; and when the people saw it, they removed and stood afar off."
Exodus,20,19,"And they said unto Moses, “Speak thou with us and we will hear; but let not God speak with us, lest we die.”"
Exodus,20,20,"And Moses said unto the people, “Fear not; for God has come to test you, and that His fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not.”"
Exodus,20,21,"And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was."
Exodus,20,22,"And the Lord said unto Moses, “Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel: ‘Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven."
Exodus,20,23,"Ye shall not make with Me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold."
Exodus,20,24,"An altar of earth thou shalt make unto Me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings and thy peace offerings, thy sheep and thine oxen. In all places where I record My name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee."
Exodus,20,25,"And if thou wilt make Me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone; for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it."
Exodus,20,26,"Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto Mine altar, that thy nakedness be not uncovered thereon.’"
Exodus,21,1,“Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them:
Exodus,21,2,"If thou buy a Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve; and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing."
Exodus,21,3,"If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself; if he was married, then his wife shall go out with him."
Exodus,21,4,"If his master has given him a wife, and she has borne him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall be her master’s, and he shall go out by himself."
Exodus,21,5,"And if the servant shall plainly say, ‘I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free,’"
Exodus,21,6,"then his master shall bring him unto the judges. He shall also bring him to the door or unto the doorpost, and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl, and he shall serve him for ever."
Exodus,21,7,"“And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do."
Exodus,21,8,"If she please not her master who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed. To sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her."
Exodus,21,9,"And if he has betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters."
Exodus,21,10,"If he take for himself another wife, her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage shall he not diminish."
Exodus,21,11,"And if he does not do these three unto her, then shall she go out free, without money."
Exodus,21,12,“He that smiteth a man so that he die shall be surely put to death.
Exodus,21,13,"And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand, then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee."
Exodus,21,14,"But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbor to slay him with guile, thou shalt take him from Mine altar, that he may die."
Exodus,21,15,“And he that smiteth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death.
Exodus,21,16,"“And he that stealeth a man and selleth him, or if he shall be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death."
Exodus,21,17,“And he that curseth his father or his mother shall surely be put to death.
Exodus,21,18,"“And if men strive together and one smite another with a stone or with his fist, and he die not but keepeth to his bed,"
Exodus,21,19,"if he rise again and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote him be acquitted; he shall only pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed."
Exodus,21,20,"“And if a man smite his servant or his maid with a rod, and he die under his hand, he shall be surely punished."
Exodus,21,21,"Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished; for he is his money."
Exodus,21,22,"“If men strive and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no misfortune follow, he shall be surely punished according as the woman’s husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine."

Exodus,36,6,"And Moses gave a commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, “Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary.” So the people were restrained from bringing,"
Exodus,36,7,"for the supply they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much."
Exodus,36,8,"And every wisehearted man among them who wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of finetwined linen, and blue and purple and scarlet; with cherubims of skillful work made he them."

Exodus,36,32,"and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides westward."
Exodus,36,33,And he made the middle bar to extend through the boards from the one end to the other.
Exodus,36,34,"And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold to be places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold."
Exodus,36,35,"And he made a veil of blue and purple and scarlet, and finetwined linen; with cherubims he made it of skillful work."
